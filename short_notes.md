# Agile Developer

* World: Needs meets reqs, quick to market, allows to evolve from emerging requirements.
* History: Gone from no process, to a heavy artifact bases process, that is punctuated. To lightweight
* What does agile offer for software developers?
* What, Why & How of being an agile dev. What is it that is different?

* Trans: I had my idea. What are other peoples?

# What is an agile developer? (Twitter)

* Alan: Concious of value
* Jenny: Outside of the column
* Paul: Touch toes
* Gary: tehcnially correct. In accordance with the beliefs and practices of agile.
* Principles like: Responding to change over plan. deliver early & frequently, working with biz every day

* Trans: this leaves a question

# Why be an agile developer?

* Simple answer: Economics. 
* Practices of agile dev let you reduce time to market, while increasing customer expectations.
* React to change by increasing feedback freq.
* Won't be much faster, but will be sustainable if you use the practices in balance.s

# Practices of an agile developer

* Three main areas. Which all practices are born from.




# AREA: Fine Scaled Feedback

* Find out if what you are doing is what you or others want as fast as possible.
* Is this what the biz wants?
* Is this code what I want?

* Trans: 3 practices that support this

# Whole team

* What: Biz, Dev, Testers. Share responsibility for delivery. WarRoom.
* Why: Reduces miscommuncation and speeds it up. Customer gets real feedback everyday

# TDD

* What: Code you wished you had. Programmer facing or Cusstomer facing. Big difference as you focus on the callers perspective.
* Why: Desgin before build. YAGNI, minimal amount of prod code. Enables other practices as it gives you the test bedrock.

# Pair Programming

* What: two folk, constant convo, design, test & code.
* Why: Typists. Thinking activity -> code is a manifestation. Analyse trade offs. code review. knowledge share.




# AREA: Continuous Process Over Batch

* Traditionally built up work into large batches: dev, test, integration.
* In process. Leaving these things late makes software undeliberable.

# Continuous Integration

* What: Commit frequently to a mainline. Every commit is built & checked by automated tests. Informed otherwise. Don't branch or leave on local machine.
* Why: Simplified & faster integrations. Customer sees latest. Shippable always.

# RefactorMercilessly

* What: Improving the design of a system without changing its behavior. Devs choose between add or refactor in story. Tests allow this.
* Why: Brittle & Inflexible takes longer to change. Battle against entropy. Design emerges. Reduce cost of change.

# SmallReleases

* What: Figure out quicker if it works. Much less likely to fail on deploy. STORY (tires)
* Why: Customer Feedback, Less risk. Agility (change course)




# AREA: Shared Understanding

* Standups part of this. Pairing and whole team.
* Also, shared understanding of the code

# SimpleDesign

* What: YAGNI, Incremental, 3 times to generalize, 4 Simple rules (test, nodupes, intent, no dead code)
* Why: Small initial investment, simple is easy to maintain, agility

# Collective Code Ownership

* What: Anyone can change anything. Bug, feature or refactor. 
* Why: Used with TDD & Pair programmingshares knowledge and encourages new ideas. Trivial one head. Less risky to departures.

# Coding Standard

* What: Collective code ownership requires that a standard is used. Just use a published standard (AirBNB).
* Why: Easier to read each others code. Refactoring support.




# How to introduce this to my workplace?

* As a manager (decree): Get people on board, start with standups (bring others in), Get CI working, then add more
* As a dev (by example): unit testing (less bugs), CI (know when things break), brown bads 

# We are still learning

* People pay us to produce software that's early to market, of high quality that meets or exceeds customer expectiations. We are still learning how to figure out exactly what to build. But weve known for a while how to build it. That is what agile development has discovered and taught us.
* Thank you.
